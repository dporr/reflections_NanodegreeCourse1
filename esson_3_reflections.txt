When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Mainly when contributing whit other people on larger projects. When I work from various sites,
as saying from my office desktop, the home computer or other different devices


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Doing this automatically could override local changes am working on,this is a not dessired behavior 
so it's more convinient to pull changes as we are needing to do so.
