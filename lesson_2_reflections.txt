What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git metadata is created into the directory and we need to start trackin files and do an initial commint.
Because whitout initialice the repo we cannot make sense of using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Is a temporal space, like a meta folder, which serves to decide which files and changes will  be commited. 
Its great beacause we cann hold on and think before commit changes or maybe have a file added to the stage during we work on it and then just commit the final version for thta specific change.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
checking git diff we can see how many changes we are next to commit. The estagin area serves as double check that we are making the right changes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you have features not directly related whit the productive version. During testing or feveloping new features. When have a team working on differente pieces of the same project
